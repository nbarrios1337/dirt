//!                 the corresponding reply and can be used by the requester
//!                 to match up replies to outstanding queries.
//! QR              A one bit field that specifies whether this message is a
//!                 query (0), or a response (1).
//! OPCODE          A four bit field that specifies kind of query in this
//!                 message.  This value is set by the originator of a query
//!                 and copied into the response.  The values are:
//!                 0               a standard query (QUERY)

//! AA              Authoritative Answer - this bit is valid in responses,

//!                 authority for the domain name in question section.

//!                 corresponds to the name which matches the query name, or
//!                 the first owner name in the answer section.
//! TC              TrunCation - specifies that this message was truncated
//!                 due to length greater than that permitted on the
//!                 transmission channel.
//! RD              Recursion Desired - this bit may be set in a query and
//!                 is copied into the response.  If RD is set, it directs
//!                 the name server to pursue the query recursively.
//!                 Recursive query support is optional.

//!                 and responses.
//! RCODE           Response code - this 4 bit field is set as part of

//!                 interpretation:

//!                 1               Format error - The name server was
//!                                 unable to interpret the query.
//!                 2               Server failure - The name server was
//!                                 unable to process this query due to a
//!                                 problem with the name server.

//!                 4               Not Implemented - The name server does
